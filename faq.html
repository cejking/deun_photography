        <ol class="faq_list">
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">Where are we based and what area do we cover?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">We are based in the Al Barsha area but more often than not we are travelling to your location.  Depending on the shoot, we can cover most areas within the Emirates, or even abroad if you are keen to pay for our business class flights and accommodation!!!!</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">How much will this cost me?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">Our generic price lists are available on the site however we are a flexible company and may be able to tailor packages to your needs so please do take a moment to contact us and we will be pleased to call you back and talk you through it or e-mail you with more information.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">What is included in the package?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">Details of what is included in each package are shown on the price sheets, please do contact us for any more detailed information or to answer specific queries, we are super-easy to talk to!</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">Do I pay by the hour or is it a fixed price?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">Some shoots are based on a 1/2 day rate, coverage of events for example, as this covers the 2 hour shoot and the subsequent editing and administration.  Some packages are an all-in fixed price which covers shoot time, prints/jpegs, we are happy to discuss your needs and come up with the most suitable packages for your time, needs and budget.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">If I hired for the day are there any additional charges for overrunning?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">If you have requested a full-day of shooting, we will have provided you with a package to complete an agreed quantity of work, a small overrun to do this is not an issue, it happens to the best of us!  Hours and hours would become a problem as we have homes to go to!</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">Do you provide digital photos/USBs?  How do I receive my photos?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">If you have been reading the above questions you almost know what I am going to say…..it depends on the package you have!  For interiors and corporate shoots we will provide you with high-resolution jpeg images via WeTransfer; for family shoots, we will go through your selection of images with you and you can choose which you would like in jpeg, print, canvas frame etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">How long after the shoot can I expect to see the images?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">This is very dependant on what our workflow is at the time of your shoot.  For corporate clients we commit to providing their edited images within 4 working days.  Family shoots will often depend on availability to review with the family.  When we start chatting about what you need and when, we open up our old-school style diaries (embarrassingly filofaxes!) and let you know there and then what we have going on and when we can get things back to you.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">What are the additional print costs?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">A question often asked, but it is a little bit like “how long is a piece of string?”, it depends on the size of the print.  All our costs are shown on the standard price lists and provide you with a guide.  There can sometimes be deviations from this, for example when you find yourselves wanting to order massive quantities of your beautiful images!</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">One or two photographers at the shoot?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">We often like to be shooting together, but if it is a small project you will only see one of us, don’t be afraid to express a preference for one of us, it helps the other one to feel bad which is only good for office banter!  Sometimes there is a need for more than 2 photographers and then you can rely on us to make sure that you get the same attention to detail and image quality.</p>

            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">How do we contact you?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">We have a contact us section on this very website, but should you be struggling for whatever reason (no judgement here) then please do see our contact info right here: <span class="faq_list_item_txt--contact">Fleur m: <a href="tel:00971508595660">050 859 5660 /</a><a href="mailto:fleur@deunphotography.com"> fleur@deunphotography.com</a></span><span class="faq_list_item_txt--contact">Wendy m: <a href="tel:00971564841153 ">056 484 1153 /<a href="mailto:wendy@deunphotography.com"> wendy@deunphotography.com</a></span> </p>

            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">Are you on social media?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">Of course! With a GenX and Millenial on-board with have Facebook and Instagram covered……not so with Twitter though. Insta: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/deunphotography/">@deunphotography</a> / Facebook:<a href="https://www.facebook.com/deunphotography/"> @deunphotography</a></p>

            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">What style of photography do you specialise in?  </h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">The awesome kind! We love studio photography and natural light photography equally. We get a kick out of getting people to be relaxed in front of the camera and getting images back that are beyond their expectation.  We love getting involved with projects people are passionate about.  We can be creative, and we can be corporate.  It is the ability for our days to be so very different that keeps our passion for good light and fun shoots going.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">Do I need to pay a deposit?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">Deposits are only required where you are booking up large amounts of our time.  We will let you know when that is.  It is only just to cover some of the losses a last minute cancellation would mean as we may have turned down other work to make your booking.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">Who owns the photos?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">The images remain the property of Deun photography.  We will however, never use images or people for marketing or social media without your express written consent.  You can ask to buy the rights to the images if you would like.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="faq_list_item">
                <h3 class="faq_list_item_title">Who will take the photos?</h3>
                <p class="faq_list_item_txt">Mostly it will be either Fleur or Wendy (us) or us with another trusted photographer, if for any reason we are not in attendance you can be assured that whoever is taking your photos will be super, and you will know this and be in agreement, well in advance of the shoot, otherwise we would reschedule.</p>
